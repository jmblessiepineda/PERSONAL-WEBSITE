				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to introduce myself . Im Jm Blessie Pineda , 17 years old . Im studying Bachelor of Science in Information Systems as a second year college student of La Verdad Christian College which is located at Sampaloc , Apalit , Pampanga.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to tell you about my little appearance . I am taller than average height for Filipino females . I have a black-long hair . To speak about my face , i have got wispy eyelids and a semi-flat nose.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am cheerful . I always try to stay positive and generous . When I'm with others , neither outgoing nor shy ,I Like to take an adequate stand situationally . I'm a couch potato . I don't want to do anything . I can't get up early and want to stay home . But I don't feel like sleeping on time . I sleep either 12midnight or past 12 . I prefer reading books than watching medias .</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take things too seriously, or perhaps not seriously enough.
				Either way, I'm the kind of woman who gets lost in thought over the kinds of things others don't seem to care about, and I find myself drawn to very unusual and 'unique' ideas, concepts and interests.</p>

				<p>I'm not as confident as I should be, and that gets in the way of a lot of things unfortunately. I believe in not speaking unless I have a firm grasp on the topic at hand or unless spoken to, which essentially makes me that girl who tends to listen more than he speaks.</p>

				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really love learning, and take the opportunity to educate myself on anything that sparks my interest. I like learning about people, too .</p>
